        <h2 style="color:#991313">David Hume</h2>
        <img src="/Users/Emily/lc101/html-me-something/Images/hume.jpg">
        <p>While not the most punk-looking of philosophers, we all know
            and love <a href="http://www.davidhume.org">Hume</a> for his 
            extraordinary number of references to 
            playing billiards and drinking wine. This punk held nothing back, 
            gunning down one philosopher after another.

        <h2 style="color:#645A5A">John Heil</h2>
        <img src="/Users/Emily/lc101/html-me-something/Images/john.jpg">
        <p>Similarly to Hume, <a href="https://philosophy.artsci.wustl.edu/people/John_Heil">
            Heil</a> does not hesitate to destroy his colleagues.
            Part of his punky charm is his tendency to dismiss every view but 
            his own as "stupid".

        <h2 style="color:#0999D1">Andy Clark</h2>
        <img src="/Users/Emily/lc101/html-me-something/Images/andy.jpg">
        <p>Well, just look at him - there's no way this philosopher could fall under
            our punk radar. <a href = "http://philosophyofbrains.com/author/clarka">
            Clark</a> is the <em>cool</em> philosopher of mind that we 
            all want to watch bad 80s movies with.

        <p>There are rumors that this "Master of Imagination Bombs" headed
            a philosphy-themed punk band in the St. Louis area. Whiny songs
            about being a brain in a vat? Yes, please, <a href="https://philosophy.artsci.wustl.edu/people/Carl_Craver">
            Dr. Craver</a>.
